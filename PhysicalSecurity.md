# Physical Security

## Notes: Physical Security (SY0-701 - 1.2)
Core Concept: Physical security involves the protection of people, data, equipment, and facilities from physical threats. It is the first layer of defense and is just as critical as digital security.

### Key Physical Security Controls
1. Access Control Vestibule (Mantrap)
Definition: A small space with two sets of interlocking doors. The second door only opens once the first door has closed and the person inside has been verified.
Purpose: To prevent tailgating (unauthorized persons following an authorized person into a secure area).
Example: A data center entrance where you badge in, enter a small room, the outer door locks, and then you must badge again or provide a second factor to open the inner door.
2. Fencing and Bollards
Fencing: Establishes a perimeter. Height and material determine its security level (e.g., 3-4 ft. indicates a boundary, 8+ ft. with razor wire is a serious barrier).
Bollards: Heavy posts, often concrete or steel, placed to prevent vehicles from ramming into a building or crashing through entrances.
3. Cameras (Video Surveillance)
Purpose: To monitor, record, and deter activity.
Key Types:
CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television): A private, self-contained video system.
IP Cameras: Digital cameras that send video over a network, allowing for remote viewing and management.
4. Access Control Systems
Definition: Methods to grant or deny physical entry.
Common Methods:
Badge Readers: Using RFID or smart cards.
Biometrics: Fingerprint, retina, or palm scanners.
Keypad/PIN Codes: Something you know.
Multi-factor Authentication: Combining methods (e.g., a badge + a PIN).
5. Alarms
Intrusion Detection Systems: Sensors (on doors, windows, or monitoring motion) that trigger a local or remote alarm when a breach is detected.
Purpose: To alert security personnel to an active incident.
6. Lighting
Purpose: A primary and low-cost deterrent. Criminals are less likely to operate in well-lit areas.
Application: Placed around the perimeter of a building, in parking lots, and other dark areas to increase visibility and surveillance capabilities.
7. Sensors
Motion Detection: Uses infrared, microwave, or acoustic technology to detect movement in a space.
Noise Detection: Sensors that trigger an alarm if a certain decibel level is exceeded (e.g., breaking glass, an explosion).
Proximity Readers: A type of sensor used in badge readers to detect a credential from a short distance.
8. Guest and Visitor Management
Process: Logging all visitors, often requiring them to present an ID, wear a temporary badge, and be escorted by an authorized employee while on the premises.

### Key Principles
Defense in Depth: Use multiple, layered physical security controls (e.g., a fence, then a guard, then a badge reader, then a mantrap).
Deter, Detect, Delay, Deny: The goals of a physical security plan are to deter intruders, detect their presence, delay their progress, and ultimately deny them access to critical assets.

### Key Takeaway
Physical security is the foundation of overall security. A network can be perfectly secure, but if an attacker can physically walk out with a server, all technical controls are irrelevant. These controls work together to protect an organization's most critical physical assets.
